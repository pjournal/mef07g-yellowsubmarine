Employing the analytical prowess of ‘dplyr’ and ‘ggplot2’ in R, our aim is to uncover patterns and variations, offering a data-driven perspective on nutritional habits within this geopolitical region.\nGlobal Dietary Database\nDataset\n\n\n# Soviet Union data cleaned up and inserted average column by calculating the mean\nsoviet_union_abbreviations &lt;- c(\"ARM\", \"AZE\", \"BLR\", \"EST\", \"GEO\", \"KAZ\", \"KGZ\", \"LVA\", \"LTU\", \"MDA\", \"RUS\", \"TJK\", \"TKM\", \"UKR\", \"UZB\")\n\nsoviet_union_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(country %in% soviet_union_abbreviations)\n\n\n# Full country names\ncountry_names &lt;- c(\n  \"Armenia\", \"Azerbaijan\", \"Belarus\", \"Estonia\", \"Georgia\", \"Kazakhstan\", \"Kyrgyzstan\", \"Latvia\", \"Lithuania\", \"Moldova\",\n  \"Russia\", \"Tajikistan\", \"Turkmenistan\", \"Ukraine\", \"Uzbekistan\"\n)\n\n# Replace country abbreviations with full names\nsoviet_union_data$country &lt;- factor(soviet_union_data$country, levels = soviet_union_abbreviations, labels = country_names)\n\n\n\n1.1.1 B12 Intakes Total Averages by Country\nThe following plot displays the total averages of B12 intakes for each country in the Former Soviet Union.

    "text": "3 Yellow Submarine’s Project Proposal on WITS data\nThe choice of this domain stems from the significance of Turkey’s role in the global trade landscape. Before settling on the WITS database, we reviewed existing solutions, including the Harvard University Atlas project and Visualizations from the Observatory of Economic Complexity.)\nWe have decided on this database considering the primary sources that include: a. Trade Partnerships: Utilize international trade databases to identify Turkey’s major trade partners, assess trade volumes, and analyze the composition of exports and imports. b. Complexity Score: Apply complexity indices to measure the sophistication of Turkey’s exports and imports, shedding light on the diversification and technological intensity of its trade activities. c. Current Account Projections: Examine historical current account data and employ forecasting models to project future trends, allowing for informed insights into Turkey’s economic stability. d. Trading Routes: Analyze shipping and logistics data to map out key trading routes, highlighting the connectivity and strategic importance of Turkey in global trade. e. Additional Insights: Explore supplementary datasets as needed to uncover specific aspects of Turkey’s trade dynamics, such as sector-specific analyses or the impact of geopolitical events.\nWith this project, we aim to produce a comprehensive report that synthesizes the findings into a coherent narrative. Visualizations, charts, and infographics will be employed to enhance the accessibility of the data.\n\n\nlibrary(tradestatistics)\n\nWarning: package 'tradestatistics' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\nlibrary(tibble)\n\nwits_turkey_data &lt;-ots_create_tidy_data(\n  years = 2018:2019,\n  reporters = \"tur\",\n  partners = \"arg\",\n  table = \"yrpc\"\n)\n\nDownloading data for the combination 2018, tur, arg...\n\n\nDownloading data for the combination 2019, tur, arg...\n\nsaveRDS(wits_turkey_data, file = \"wits_data.rds\")\ndata &lt;- readRDS(\"wits_data.rds\")\ndata\n\n      year reporter_iso reporter_name partner_iso partner_name commodity_code\n   1: 2018          tur        Turkey         arg    Argentina         010121\n   2: 2018          tur        Turkey         arg    Argentina         010620\n   3: 2018          tur        Turkey         arg    Argentina         020220\n   4: 2019          tur        Turkey         arg    Argentina         020220\n   5: 2018          tur        Turkey         arg    Argentina         020230\n  ---                                                                        \n1779: 2018          tur        Turkey         arg    Argentina         961610\n1780: 2019          tur        Turkey         arg    Argentina         961610\n1781: 2018          tur        Turkey         arg    Argentina         970500\n1782: 2018          tur        Turkey         arg    Argentina         999999\n1783: 2019          tur        Turkey         arg    Argentina         999999\n                                                                                                                                                                  commodity_name\n   1:                                                                                                                                   Horses;

Before settling on the WITS database, we reviewed existing solutions, including the Harvard University Atlas project and Visualizations from the Observatory of Economic Complexity.)\nWe have decided on this database considering the primary sources that include: a. Trade Partnerships: Utilize international trade databases to identify Turkey’s major trade partner and assess trade volumes b. Composition of Exports&Imports: Analyze composition of exports and imports data by complexity for each commodity c. Additional Insights: Explore supplementary datasets as needed to uncover specific aspects of Turkey’s trade dynamics, such as tariffs and distances data to map out key trading routes, highlighting the connectivity and strategic importance of Turkey in global trade.\nWith this project, we aim to produce a comprehensive report that synthesizes the findings into a coherent narrative.

    "text": "3.2 Key Takeways\n\nFor the analysis period which is between 2002 and 2020, Turkey kept its net importer position in majority of the product categories that are primarily used as an intermediary in industrials\nTurkey’s dependence on energy and natural resources is concentrated, posing a significant risk if relations with Russia and Iran were to deteriorate. A similar vulnerability is observed in machinery and mechanical components, suggesting the need for diversification or incentives to encourage local production.\nTurkey has close relations with Europe, taking advantage of being a signatory of custom union with the EU. On the contrary; the exposure to Europe, as evidenced in the EDA, underscores a category risk for Turkey. Economic downturns or recessions in Europe significantly impact Turkey’s exports and imports.\nWhile Turkey boasts more than 200 trading partners for both exports and imports, the high revenue-generating product categories lack diversification. Most of the top 10 product categories show stagnant or declining growth in USD values. This signals the importance of exploring new markets and expanding the product portfolio to mitigate risks associated with concentrated trade.\nAs the main outcome; this EDA reveals Turkey’s heavy reliance on intermediate goods and a relatively lower emphasis on strategic investments in R&D and incentives for a skilled workforce, pointing out a necessity of adopting a new economic model, which encourages innovation, reduces dependence on intermediates, increasing diversification of trade partners and ensures a more sustainable and resilient trade ecosystem."

Notably, there was a slowdown in total trade values in 2009, coinciding with the global financial crisis of 2008. The decline in 2015 can be attributed to the implementation of quantitative easing in Europe, implemented after European debt crisis and recession, leading to an increased money supply in the region and devaluation of the EUR against USD. Further analysis within this EDA reveals the EU as a crucial economic partner for Turkey, and EUR/USD exchange rate playing a significant role in affecting Turkey’s export values. Up until the onset of the global COVID-19 crisis in 2020, Turkey consistently increased its export values. Contrary to exports, import value has increased in 2020 as an indicator of increased dependency.\nLet’s conduct a more in-depth analysis to determine the product categories in which Turkey holds a strong position in its exports.\n\n\nCode\ntop_export_products &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_export = sum(trade_value_usd_exp)) %&gt;%\n  na.omit() \n  \ntop_export_products &lt;- top_export_products %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(total_export))\ntop_export_products$total_export &lt;- scales::number_format(suffix = \"M\")(top_export_products$total_export / 1e6)\n\nDT::datatable(top_export_products, colnames = c('Section Name', 'Total Export(USD)'),options = list(pageLength = 9))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nexport_plot_data &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_export = sum(trade_value_usd_exp)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10)\n\n# Truncate section names to the first 20 characters\nexport_plot_data$truncated_name &lt;- str_trunc(export_plot_data$section_name, 50)\n\n# Get distinct truncated names for colors\ncolor_names &lt;- unique(export_plot_data$truncated_name)\n\n# Generate a limited number of distinct colors\ncolors &lt;- brewer.pal(length(color_names), \"Set3\")\n\nggplot(data = export_plot_data, aes(x = reorder(section_name, -total_export), y = total_export, fill = truncated_name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Diversity of Exported Products (2002-2020, Turkey)\", x = \"Products\", y = \"Total Export Value (USD)\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"black\", size = 0.5) +  # Add horizontal line at y = 0\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank(), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 5)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = setNames(colors, color_names), name = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings: Textiles and apparel, machinery and equipment, vehicles and associated equipment, as well as base metals and mineral products, constitute significant contributors to Turkey’s export revenue. Findings from a study conducted by the Turkey Exporters Assembly (TEA), which defines the top 1000 exports, align with our observations. Prominent exporter companies in Turkey are engaged in the export of vehicles and spare parts, home appliances, and the export of base metals and mineral products. Examples include Ford Otosan, Arcelik, Erdemir and Kibar Holding. The study also highlights the presence of textile manufacturers on the list, although they may not be top-rated, indicating a higher number of companies in this category compared to others in Turkey.

Initial thoughts focused on factors like steel industry dynamics, potential sanctions and commodity crises. Additionally, fluctuations in Turkey’s gold exports and imports which exhibited up and downs over recent years are also considered.In 2020, a downward trend was noted in every product category, except for essential items such as vegetable products, plastics, and foodstuff, which exhibited inelastic demand and remained resilient during the pandemic.\nLet’s conduct a more in-depth analysis to determine the product categories in which Turkey is most dependent on its imports.\n\n\nCode\ntop_import_products &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %&gt;%\n  na.omit() \n  \ntop_import_products &lt;- top_import_products %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(total_import))\ntop_import_products$total_import &lt;- scales::number_format(suffix = \"M\")(top_import_products$total_import / 1e6)\ndatatable(top_import_products, colnames = c('Section Name', 'Total Import(USD)'),options = list(pageLength = 9))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimported_plot_data &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10)\n\n# Truncate section names to the first 20 characters\nimported_plot_data$truncated_name &lt;- str_trunc(imported_plot_data$section_name, 50)\n\n# Get distinct truncated names for colors\ncolor_names &lt;- unique(imported_plot_data$truncated_name)\n\n# Generate a limited number of distinct colors\ncolors &lt;- brewer.pal(length(color_names), \"Set3\")\n\nggplot(data = imported_plot_data, aes(x = reorder(section_name, -total_import), y = total_import, fill = truncated_name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Diversity of Imported Products (2002-2020, Turkey)\", x = \"Products\", y = \"Total Import Value (USD)\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"black\", size = 0.5) +  # Add horizontal line at y = 0\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank(), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 5)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = setNames(colors, color_names), name = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings: Machinery and equipment, base metals and their articles, mineral products, chemicals as well as vehicles and associated equipment constitute the primary import categories contributing to Turkey’s import value. There is a substantial import of investment goods, components and parts, along with unprocessed materials used in industrial activities. This highlights Turkey’s dependence on a significant influx of intermediate goods.\nBased on these observations, there is a need for a strategic focus on R&D investments and incentives for a highly skilled workforce. This is crucial for adoption of a new economic model, which Turkey could leverage to reduce its reliance on intermediate goods.\nLet’s examine the trend analysis of these product categories from 2002 to 2020\n\n\nCode\ntop_import_products &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10)%&gt;%\n  na.omit() \n\ntop_import_products &lt;- top_import_products %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    section_name = case_when(\n        str_detect(section_name, \"^Machinery and mechanical appliances\") ~ \"Machinery Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Base metals\") ~ \"Metal Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Natural or\") ~ \"Natural Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Vehicles,\") ~ \"Transport Equipment\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Plastics and articles\") ~ \"Plastics\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Product of the chemicals\") ~ \"Chemicals\",\n      TRUE ~ as.character(section_name)\n    )\n  )\n\nread_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_edit &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners%&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    section_name = case_when(\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Machinery and mechanical appliances\") ~ \"Machinery Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Base metals\") ~ \"Metal Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Natural or\") ~ \"Natural Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Vehicles,\") ~ \"Transport Equipment\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Plastics and articles\") ~ \"Plastics\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Product of the chemicals\") ~ \"Chemicals\",\n      TRUE ~ as.character(section_name)\n    )\n  )\n\n# Filter the data with the selected top import products\nimport_plot_data &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_edit %&gt;%\n  filter(section_name %in% top_import_products$section_name) %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()  \n\n# Create the plot with geom_point\nggplot(data = import_plot_data, aes(x = year, y = total_import, color = section_name)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~section_name, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 3, labeller = labeller(NULL)) +\n  labs(title = \"Import Trends of Top 9 Products (2002-2020, Turkey)\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Total Import Value (USD)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  # Remove legend\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings: First slowdown in imports of all product categories is observed in 2009 reflecting ongoing effects of global crisis in 2008.

During EDA, we have realized that energy is not categorized in this dataset of which seems under NA in this illustration. Turkey’s energy dependency to Russia and Iran of which are major natural gas, crude and mineral suppliers of Turkey. Turkey terminated its crude supplies from Iran after 2018 when US imposed sanctions on Iranian products. Examining Turkey’s major imports, it becomes evident that China and Germany play pivotal roles, particularly in the supply of machinery and mechanical components vital for industrial processes. Conversely, Turkey exhibits minimal dependency on textile and vegetable imports, reflecting its advantageous position as a net exporter in these product categories."

    "text": "4.2 Key Takeways\n\nFor the analysis period which is between 2002 and 2020, Turkey kept ist net importer position in majority of the product categories that are primarily used as an intermediary in industrials\nTurkey’s dependence on energy and natural resources is concentrated, posing a significant risk if relations with Russia and Iran were to deteriorate. A similar vulnerability is observed in machinery and mechanical components, suggesting the need for diversification or incentives to encourage local production.\nTurkey has close relations with Europe, taking advantage of being a signatory of custom union with the EU. On the contrary; the exposure to Europe, as evidenced in the EDA, underscores a category risk for Turkey. Economic downturns or recessions in Europe significantly impact Turkey’s exports and imports.\nWhile Turkey boasts more than 200 trading partners for both exports and imports, the high revenue-generating product categories lack diversification. Most of the top 10 product categories show stagnant or declining growth in USD values. This signals the importance of exploring new markets and expanding the product portfolio to mitigate risks associated with concentrated trade.\nAs the main outcome; this EDA reveals Turkey’s heavy reliance on intermediate goods and a relatively lower emphasis on strategic investments in R&D and incentives for a skilled workforce, pointing out a necessity of adopting a new economic model, which encourages innovation, reduces dependence on intermediates, increasing diversification of trade partners and ensures a more sustainable and resilient trade ecosystem."

Notably, there was a slowdown in total trade values in 2009, coinciding with the global financial crisis of 2008. The decline in 2015 can be attributed to the implementation of quantitative easing in Europe, implemented after European debt crisis and recession, leading to an increased money supply in the region and devaluation of the EUR against USD. Further analysis within this EDA reveals the EU as a crucial economic partner for Turkey, and EUR/USD exchange rate playing a significant role in affecting Turkey’s export values. Up until the onset of the global COVID-19 crisis in 2020, Turkey consistently increased its export values. Contrary to exports, import value has increased in 2020 as an indicator of increased dependency.\nLet’s conduct a more in-depth analysis to determine the product categories in which Turkey holds a strong position in its exports.\n\n\nCode\ntop_export_products &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_export = sum(trade_value_usd_exp)) %&gt;%\n  na.omit() \n  \ntop_export_products &lt;- top_export_products %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(total_export))\ntop_export_products$total_export &lt;- scales::number_format(suffix = \"M\")(top_export_products$total_export / 1e6)\n\nDT::datatable(top_export_products, colnames = c('Section Name', 'Total Export(USD)'),options = list(pageLength = 9))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nexport_plot_data &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_export = sum(trade_value_usd_exp)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10)\n\n# Truncate section names to the first 20 characters\nexport_plot_data$truncated_name &lt;- str_trunc(export_plot_data$section_name, 50)\n\n# Get distinct truncated names for colors\ncolor_names &lt;- unique(export_plot_data$truncated_name)\n\n# Generate a limited number of distinct colors\ncolors &lt;- brewer.pal(length(color_names), \"Set3\")\n\nggplot(data = export_plot_data, aes(x = reorder(section_name, -total_export), y = total_export, fill = truncated_name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Diversity of Exported Products (2002-2020, Turkey)\", x = \"Products\", y = \"Total Export Value (USD)\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"black\", size = 0.5) +  # Add horizontal line at y = 0\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank(), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 5)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = setNames(colors, color_names), name = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings: Textiles and apparel, machinery and equipment, vehicles and associated equipment, as well as base metals and mineral products, constitute significant contributors to Turkey’s export revenue. Findings from a study conducted by the Turkey Exporters Assembly (TEA), which defines the top 1000 exports, align with our observations. Prominent exporter companies in Turkey are engaged in the export of vehicles and spare parts, home appliances, and the export of base metals and mineral products. Examples include Ford Otosan, Arcelik, Erdemir and Kibar Holding. The study also highlights the presence of textile manufacturers on the list, although they may not be top-rated, indicating a higher number of companies in this category compared to others in Turkey.

Initial thoughts focused on factors like steel industry dynamics, potential sanctions and commodity crises. Additionally, fluctuations in Turkey’s gold exports and imports which exhibited up and downs over recent years are also considered.In 2020, a downward trend was noted in every product category, except for essential items such as vegetable products, plastics, and foodstuff, which exhibited inelastic demand and remained resilient during the pandemic.\nLet’s conduct a more in-depth analysis to determine the product categories in which Turkey is most dependent on its imports.\n\n\nCode\ntop_import_products &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %&gt;%\n  na.omit() \n  \ntop_import_products &lt;- top_import_products %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(total_import))\ntop_import_products$total_import &lt;- scales::number_format(suffix = \"M\")(top_import_products$total_import / 1e6)\ndatatable(top_import_products, colnames = c('Section Name', 'Total Import(USD)'),options = list(pageLength = 9))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimported_plot_data &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10)\n\n# Truncate section names to the first 20 characters\nimported_plot_data$truncated_name &lt;- str_trunc(imported_plot_data$section_name, 50)\n\n# Get distinct truncated names for colors\ncolor_names &lt;- unique(imported_plot_data$truncated_name)\n\n# Generate a limited number of distinct colors\ncolors &lt;- brewer.pal(length(color_names), \"Set3\")\n\nggplot(data = imported_plot_data, aes(x = reorder(section_name, -total_import), y = total_import, fill = truncated_name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Diversity of Imported Products (2002-2020, Turkey)\", x = \"Products\", y = \"Total Import Value (USD)\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"black\", size = 0.5) +  # Add horizontal line at y = 0\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank(), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 5)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = setNames(colors, color_names), name = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings: Machinery and equipment, base metals and their articles, mineral products, chemicals as well as vehicles and associated equipment constitute the primary import categories contributing to Turkey’s import value. There is a substantial import of investment goods, components and parts, along with unprocessed materials used in industrial activities. This highlights Turkey’s dependence on a significant influx of intermediate goods.\nBased on these observations, there is a need for a strategic focus on R&D investments and incentives for a highly skilled workforce. This is crucial for adoption of a new economic model, which Turkey could leverage to reduce its reliance on intermediate goods.\nLet’s examine the trend analysis of these product categories from 2002 to 2020\n\n\nCode\ntop_import_products &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_only %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10)%&gt;%\n  na.omit() \n\ntop_import_products &lt;- top_import_products %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    section_name = case_when(\n        str_detect(section_name, \"^Machinery and mechanical appliances\") ~ \"Machinery Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Base metals\") ~ \"Metal Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Natural or\") ~ \"Natural Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Vehicles,\") ~ \"Transport Equipment\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Plastics and articles\") ~ \"Plastics\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Product of the chemicals\") ~ \"Chemicals\",\n      TRUE ~ as.character(section_name)\n    )\n  )\n\nread_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_edit &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners%&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    section_name = case_when(\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Machinery and mechanical appliances\") ~ \"Machinery Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Base metals\") ~ \"Metal Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Natural or\") ~ \"Natural Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Vehicles,\") ~ \"Transport Equipment\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Plastics and articles\") ~ \"Plastics\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Product of the chemicals\") ~ \"Chemicals\",\n      TRUE ~ as.character(section_name)\n    )\n  )\n\n# Filter the data with the selected top import products\nimport_plot_data &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_edit %&gt;%\n  filter(section_name %in% top_import_products$section_name) %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()  \n\n# Create the plot with geom_point\nggplot(data = import_plot_data, aes(x = year, y = total_import, color = section_name)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~section_name, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 3, labeller = labeller(NULL)) +\n  labs(title = \"Import Trends of Top 9 Products (2002-2020, Turkey)\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Total Import Value (USD)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  # Remove legend\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings: First slowdown in imports of all product categories is observed in 2009 reflecting ongoing effects of global crisis in 2008. Import values of mineral and natural products fluctuated during analysis period, requires further investigation as it has been mentioned in exports section. Analysis for product categories of vegetables and plastics under export section remains applicable for imports, showcasing inelastic demand during pandemic.\n\n\n4.4.2 Trade Partnership Analysis\nEnsuring a broad range of diverse trade partners is crucial for any country in order to diversify its export and import streams and serves as a risk mitigation strategy, particularly in the face of any possible geopolitical challenges.\nThis chart aims to assess Turkey’s revenue generation capacity by scrutinizing top 10 product category.

As previously noted in the above sections of this EDA; Textiles and Apparel, Vehicles and Associated Equipment and Base Metals and Mineral Products stand out as significant contributors to Turkey’s export revenue. Despite a trend of non-growth or decline in revenue generation, these categories exhibited the highest revenue generation in 2020. Conversely, Mineral Products, Miscellaneous Manufactured Articles, Vegetable Products and Plastics demonstrated an increased capacity for revenue generation over the last five years, albeit still trailing behind the primary product categories mentioned earlier.\nThis chart aims to assess Turkey’s dependency on imports for its top 10 product categories and to understand diversity of Turkey’s trade partners, identifying leading import sources in 2020 and evaluating the performance of these sources over the past five years.\n\n\nCode\n# Step 1: Find the top 10 section_name based on trade_value\ntop_sections &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(total_import)) %&gt;%\n  head(15)\n\n# Step 2: Filter the dataframe to include only the top 10 section_names\nread_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10 &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners %&gt;%\n  filter(section_name %in% top_sections$section_name)\n\n# Step 3: Count partner_names corresponding to the top 10 section_names in the entire dataframe\nread_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10  &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10  %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(partner_count = n_distinct(partner_name)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nread_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10 &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10 %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(cagr = ((trade_value_usd_imp[2020]/trade_value_usd_imp[2015])^(1/5)-1)*100) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nread_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10 &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10 %&gt;%\n  filter(year == 2020) %&gt;%\n  group_by(section_name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(total_trade_value_imp_2020 = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)/1000000) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Truncate section names to the first 50 characters\nread_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10$truncated_name &lt;- str_trunc(read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10$section_name, 50)\n\n# Get distinct truncated names for colors\ncolor_names &lt;- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10$truncated_name\n\n\nggplot(read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10, aes(x = partner_count, y = total_trade_value_imp_2020, size = cagr, color = truncated_name)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(3, 15)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10$total_trade_value_imp_2020), max(read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10$total_trade_value_imp_2020) + 5)) + # adjust y-axis scale\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10$partner_count), max(read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10$partner_count) + 5)) +  # adjust x-axis scale\n  scale_color_manual(values = scales::hue_pal()(length(unique(read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_top10$section_name)))) +  # Use a different color palette\n  labs(title = \"Import Partner and Import Value Growth Analysis for Top 10 Product Categories\",\n       x = \"Number of Importers\",\n       y = \"Total Import mn USD (2020) \",\n       size = \"5 year CAGR\", \n       color = \"Section Name\") +\ntheme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",  \n    legend.box = \"horizontal\",   \n    legend.margin = margin(t = 0, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0)  \n    \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings: Through this analysis, we have identified that Turkey’s dependency is diversified and country engages with more than 200 distinct import partners across its top 10 product categories, excluding natural product categories (mostly composed of semi-precious products, stones and powder that may be used for construction industry). Despite declining trend, machinery and mechanical appliances exhibited the highest import stream in 2020 of which has the highest number of trade partners. Conversely, plastics and chemicals demonstrated an increased import value over the last five years, albeit still trailing behind the primary product categories mentioned earlier.\nTurkey showcases a diverse range of trading partners.

During EDA, we have realized that energy is not categorized in this dataset of which seems under NA in this illustration. Turkey’s energy dependency to Russia and Iran of which are major natural gas, crude and mineral suppliers of Turkey. Turkey terminated its crude supplies from Iran after 2018 when US imposed sanctions on Iranian products. Examining Turkey’s major imports, it becomes evident that China and Germany play pivotal roles, particularly in the supply of machinery and mechanical components vital for industrial processes. Conversely, Turkey exhibits minimal dependency on textile and vegetable imports, reflecting its advantageous position as a net exporter in these product categories.\n\n\n4.4.3 Conclusion\nIn the expansive world of global trade, Turkey demonstrates practical adaptability, resilience, and strategic insight. The examination of its trade balance, net position, and partnerships unfolds a story of economic growth. As Turkey moves forward, navigating the international trade waters, the insights drawn from this analysis act as a practical guide — an aid for informed decision-making and strategic planning.\nTurkey’s trade story isn’t confined to numbers on spreadsheets; it’s a living account, alive with the energy of economic interaction. As the nation faces the completixities of the global economy, the focus on trade balance and partnerships lights the way toward sustainable and robust economic development.\n\n\n4.4.4 Shiny App Link\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(shiny)\nshiny::runGitHub(\"pjournal/mef07g-yellowsubmarine\", subdir = \"/app/app.R\")\n\n\nShiny App Link is here.\n\n\n4.4.5 References\nWorld Integrated Trade Solution (World Bank)\nDataset"

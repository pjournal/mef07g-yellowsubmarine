This powerful tool aggregates data from diverse sources to furnish users with valuable insights into Turkey's merchandise trade, tariffs, and non-tariff measures during this specific period. With an expansive database, WITS facilitates informed decision-making and strategic planning for researchers, policymakers, and businesses interested in Turkey's trade landscape.\n\nEmbarking on an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) journey within WITS involves loading datasets, cleaning data, and employing statistical and visual analyses specific to Turkey's trade from 2002 to 2020. This process unveils trade patterns, identifies trends, and provides actionable insights, enabling stakeholders to navigate the complexities of Turkey's trade dynamics during this crucial timeframe. The synergy between WITS and EDA empowers users to make informed decisions and strategic choices, fostering a more interconnected and informed landscape for Turkey's economy and trade.\n\n## Key Takeways\n\n1.  For the analysis period which is between 2002 and 2020, Turkey kept ist net importer position in majority of the product categories that are primarily used as an intermediary in industrials\n\n2.  Turkey's dependence on energy and natural resources is concentrated, posing a significant risk if relations with Russia and Iran were to deteriorate. A similar vulnerability is observed in machinery and mechanical components, suggesting the need for diversification or incentives to encourage local production.\n\n3.  Turkey has close relations with Europe, taking advantage of being a signatory of custom union with the EU. On the contrary; the exposure to Europe, as evidenced in the EDA, underscores a category risk for Turkey. Economic downturns or recessions in Europe significantly impact Turkey's exports and imports.\n\n4.  While Turkey boasts more than 200 trading partners for both exports and imports, the high revenue-generating product categories lack diversification. Most of the top 10 product categories show stagnant or declining growth in USD values. This signals the importance of exploring new markets and expanding the product portfolio to mitigate risks associated with concentrated trade.\n\n5.  As the main outcome; this EDA reveals Turkey's heavy reliance on intermediate goods and a relatively lower emphasis on strategic investments in R&D and incentives for a skilled workforce, pointing out a necessity of adopting a new economic model, which encourages innovation, reduces dependence on intermediates, increasing diversification of trade partners and ensures a more sustainable and resilient trade ecosystem.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Exports & Imports Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntotal_exports <- read_wits_turkey_data_only %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarize(total_exports = sum(trade_value_usd_exp))\n\ntotal_imports <- read_wits_turkey_data_only %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarize(total_imports = sum(trade_value_usd_imp))\n\n# Visualize exports and imports over the years\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data = total_exports, aes(x = year, y = total_exports, color = \"Exports\"), size = 1.5) +\n  geom_line(data = total_imports, aes(x = year, y = total_imports, color = \"Imports\"), size = 1.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Turkey's Exports and Imports Over the Years\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Trade Value (USD)\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finalreport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Findings:** Turkey has experienced a consistent upward trajectory in both exports and imports from 2002 to 2020, as measured in USD values, influenced by factors such as price dynamics, quantities, and currency exchange rates. Notably, there was a slowdown in total trade values in 2009, coinciding with the global financial crisis of 2008. The decline in 2015 can be attributed to the implementation of quantitative easing in Europe, implemented after European debt crisis and recession, leading to an increased money supply in the region and devaluation of the EUR against USD. Further analysis within this EDA reveals the EU as a crucial economic partner for Turkey, and EUR/USD exchange rate playing a significant role in affecting Turkey's export values. Up until the onset of the global COVID-19 crisis in 2020, Turkey consistently increased its export values. Contrary to exports, import value has increased in 2020 as an indicator of increased dependency.\n\nLet's conduct a more in-depth analysis to determine the product categories in which Turkey holds a strong position in its exports.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexport_plot_data <- read_wits_turkey_data_only %>%\n  group_by(section_name) %>%\n  summarize(total_export = sum(trade_value_usd_exp)) %>%\n  top_n(10)\n\n# Truncate section names to the first 20 characters\nexport_plot_data$truncated_name <- str_trunc(export_plot_data$section_name, 50)\n\n# Get distinct truncated names for colors\ncolor_names <- unique(export_plot_data$truncated_name)\n\n# Generate a limited number of distinct colors\ncolors <- brewer.pal(length(color_names), \"Set3\")\n\nggplot(data = export_plot_data, aes(x = reorder(section_name, -total_export), y = total_export, fill = truncated_name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Diversity of Exported Products (2002-2020, Turkey)\", x = \"Products\", y = \"Total Export Value (USD)\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"black\", size = 0.5) +  # Add horizontal line at y = 0\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank(), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 5)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = setNames(colors, color_names), name = \"\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finalreport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Findings:** Textiles and apparel, machinery and equipment, vehicles and associated equipment, as well as base metals and mineral products, constitute significant contributors to Turkey's export revenue. Findings from a study conducted by the Turkey Exporters Assembly (TEA), which defines the top 1000 exports, align with our observations. Prominent exporter companies in Turkey are engaged in the export of vehicles and spare parts, home appliances, and the export of base metals and mineral products. Examples include Ford Otosan, Arcelik, Erdemir and Kibar Holding. The study also highlights the presence of textile manufacturers on the list, although they may not be top-rated, indicating a higher number of companies in this category compared to others in Turkey.

Initial thoughts focused on factors like steel industry dynamics, potential sanctions and commodity crises. Additionally, fluctuations in Turkey's gold exports and imports which exhibited up and downs over recent years are also considered.In 2020, a downward trend was noted in every product category, except for essential items such as vegetable products, plastics, and foodstuff, which exhibited inelastic demand and remained resilient during the pandemic.\n\nLet's conduct a more in-depth analysis to determine the product categories in which Turkey is most dependent on its imports.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nimported_plot_data <- read_wits_turkey_data_only %>%\n  group_by(section_name) %>%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %>%\n  top_n(10)\n\n# Truncate section names to the first 20 characters\nimported_plot_data$truncated_name <- str_trunc(imported_plot_data$section_name, 50)\n\n# Get distinct truncated names for colors\ncolor_names <- unique(imported_plot_data$truncated_name)\n\n# Generate a limited number of distinct colors\ncolors <- brewer.pal(length(color_names), \"Set3\")\n\nggplot(data = imported_plot_data, aes(x = reorder(section_name, -total_import), y = total_import, fill = truncated_name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Diversity of Imported Products (2002-2020, Turkey)\", x = \"Products\", y = \"Total Import Value (USD)\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"black\", size = 0.5) +  # Add horizontal line at y = 0\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank(), legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 5)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = setNames(colors, color_names), name = \"\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finalreport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Findings:** Machinery and equipment, base metals and their articles, mineral products, chemicals as well as vehicles and associated equipment constitute the primary import categories contributing to Turkey's import value. There is a substantial import of investment goods, components and parts, along with unprocessed materials used in industrial activities. This highlights Turkey's dependence on a significant influx of intermediate goods.\n\nBased on these observations, there is a need for a strategic focus on R&D investments and incentives for a highly skilled workforce. This is crucial for adoption of a new economic model, which Turkey could leverage to reduce its reliance on intermediate goods.\n\nLet's examine the trend analysis of these product categories from 2002 to 2020\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntop_import_products <- read_wits_turkey_data_only %>%\n  group_by(section_name) %>%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %>%\n  top_n(10)%>%\n  na.omit() \n\ntop_import_products <- top_import_products %>% \n  mutate(\n    section_name = case_when(\n        str_detect(section_name, \"^Machinery and mechanical appliances\") ~ \"Machinery Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Base metals\") ~ \"Metal Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Natural or\") ~ \"Natural Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Vehicles,\") ~ \"Transport Equipment\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Plastics and articles\") ~ \"Plastics\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Product of the chemicals\") ~ \"Chemicals\",\n      TRUE ~ as.character(section_name)\n    )\n  )\n\nread_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_edit <- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners%>% \n  mutate(\n    section_name = case_when(\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Machinery and mechanical appliances\") ~ \"Machinery Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Base metals\") ~ \"Metal Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Natural or\") ~ \"Natural Products\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Vehicles,\") ~ \"Transport Equipment\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Plastics and articles\") ~ \"Plastics\",\n      str_detect(section_name, \"^Product of the chemicals\") ~ \"Chemicals\",\n      TRUE ~ as.character(section_name)\n    )\n  )\n\n# Filter the data with the selected top import products\nimport_plot_data <- read_wits_turkey_data_with_partners_edit %>%\n  filter(section_name %in% top_import_products$section_name) %>%\n  group_by(year, section_name) %>%\n  summarize(total_import = sum(trade_value_usd_imp)) %>%\n  ungroup()  \n\n# Create the plot with geom_point\nggplot(data = import_plot_data, aes(x = year, y = total_import, color = section_name)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~section_name, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 3, labeller = labeller(NULL)) +\n  labs(title = \"Import Trends of Top 9 Products (2002-2020, Turkey)\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Total Import Value (USD)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  # Remove legend\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](finalreport_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Findings**: First slowdown in imports of all product categories is observed in 2009 reflecting ongoing effects of global crisis in 2008.

During EDA, we have realized that energy is not categorized in this dataset of which seems under NA in this illustration. Turkey's energy dependency to Russia and Iran of which are major natural gas, crude and mineral suppliers of Turkey. Turkey terminated its crude supplies from Iran after 2018 when US imposed sanctions on Iranian products. Examining Turkey's major imports, it becomes evident that China and Germany play pivotal roles, particularly in the supply of machinery and mechanical components vital for industrial processes. Conversely, Turkey exhibits minimal dependency on textile and vegetable imports, reflecting its advantageous position as a net exporter in these product categories.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn the expansive world of global trade, Turkey demonstrates practical adaptability, resilience, and strategic insight. The examination of its trade balance, net position, and partnerships unfolds a story of economic growth. As Turkey moves forward, navigating the international trade waters, the insights drawn from this analysis act as a practical guide — an aid for informed decision-making and strategic planning.\n\nTurkey’s trade story isn’t confined to numbers on spreadsheets; it’s a living account, alive with the energy of economic interaction. As the nation faces the completixities of the global economy, the focus on trade balance and partnerships lights the way toward sustainable and robust economic development.\n\n### Shiny App Link\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(shiny)\nshiny::runGitHub(\"pjournal/mef07g-yellowsubmarine\", subdir = \"/app/app.R\")\n```\n:::\n\n[Shiny App Link is here.](https://sezerlucianturkmen.shinyapps.io/yellowsubmarine/)\n\n### References\n\n[*World Integrated Trade Solution (World Bank)*](https://wits.worldbank.org/)\n\n\n[*Dataset*](https://docs.ropensci.org/tradestatistics/articles/basic-usage.html)",

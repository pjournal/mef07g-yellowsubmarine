::: {.callout-caution title="Setup To-Do"}

Here is the list of items to properly set this Progress Journal up.

1. Replace the name placeholder "YELLOW SUBMARINE" on `index.qmd` with your name or group name.
2. Replace the name placeholder "YELLOW SUBMARINE" on `_quarto.yml` with your name or group name.
3. Replace the repository link `https://github.com/pjournal/mef07g-yellowsubmarine` with your or your group's repository link.
4. If this is a group PJ, follow the instructions in comments on `index.qmd` and add members, group name, project name and project short description.
5. If this repository does not use RStudio/Posit, then you can also remove `.Rproj` file. Otherwise rename it with your repository name (e.g, mefXX-reponame).

Then test with `quarto preview` on Terminal. If everything is ok, execute `quarto render` command in Terminal.

**Finally, delete the above section (including this sentence) and (GitHub) push the changes to your repository.**
